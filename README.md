# AKpanel
A future project to create a hosting panel


A future project aimed at creating a simple hosting panel. Everything will gradually start, so we will try to begin by setting up a complete installation of all the required components and configuring them smoothly while solving any arising issues. Then, one by one, we will start adding features and steps.

I aspire to create a complete control panel that utilizes Ubuntu 22.04 in a simplified manner.
